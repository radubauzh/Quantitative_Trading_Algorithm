# Quantitative Trading Algorithm

Welcome to the **Quantitative Trading Algorithm** repository for the **Investments â€“ Selected Quantitative Tools (L)** course at the University of Zurich. This repository is dedicated to the practical application of financial forecasting and machine learning techniques for developing a quantitative trading algorithm focused on the S&P 500 market data.

## Course Overview
You'll find all the necessary materials and resources to use our robust prediction-based trading strategy in this repository. Our journey will encompass various advanced topics such as:

- **Financial Forecasting**: Techniques for predicting short-term returns in financial markets.
- **Estimation Methods**: Comparative analysis of Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian estimation.
- **Kernel Machines**: Application of Support Vector Machines and other kernel-based methods.
- **Neural Networks**: Implementation of deep learning models including Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks.
- **Model Selection**: Criteria and techniques for selecting optimal models for trading strategies.
- **Probabilistic Models**: Utilizing probabilistic approaches to capture market dynamics.
- **Sequence Modeling**: Predictive modeling of time series data using recurrent architectures.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Enhancing model performance through attention-based architectures.

## Key Components
- **Reading Materials**: You can find more information about the concepts used in the following textbooks:
  - *Deep Learning* by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.
  - *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* by Christopher M. Bishop.
